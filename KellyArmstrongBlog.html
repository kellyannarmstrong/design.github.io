      <h2>An Overview of Digital Marketing Campaigns</h2>
      <p>A digital marketing campaign is a big-picture plan that uses digital strategy to achieve a company’s objective. Successful design of these campaigns can result in enhanced performance and lead generation, improved conversion rates, higher revenues, and a better brand reputation. Five commonly used digital marketing campaign types include social media marketing campaigns, content marketing campaigns, off-page CEO campaigns, email campaigns, and omnichannel marketing campaigns.
      <p>Aside from business and e-commerce, these campaigns also serve a vital role in the dissemination of public health and philanthropic messages. Creativity and a genuine understanding of the target audience of your message can make all the difference in the success of a campaign design. Authenticity can also go a long way, and is a key factor in what makes certain campaigns go “viral”. Some of the most memorable 2018 digital marketing campaigns so far range from commercials, billboards, and social media ad series.
      <p>One example of influencer marketing and powerful video content working together is Amazon’s Alexa commercial. This campaign, dubbed “Alexa Has Lost Her Voice”, featured a diverse range of world-renowned celebrities and aired at the superbowl, eventually earning a whopping 47 million views. This digital marketing campaign is a prime example of the power of creative humor and influencer marketing.

      <h2>The Role of Search Engine Optimization</h2>
      <p>What is SEO, and why is it important in digital marketing campaigns?</p>
      <p>SEO is an acronym that stands for search engine optimization, and it is a vital tool that ensures that websites are easy to find, surf, and organize. SEO works by enabling online visibility in non-paid search engine results, depending on key words. This is where the marketing aspect comes in - marketers must have a firm grasp on what its customers are seeking. It is a key component in digital marketing campaigns because it helps online customers find what sets your business apart from thousands of other similar vendors on the web. CEO of Bloom Worldwide Kate Cooper states that “digital marketing has tracking capabilities that generates data, whereas traditional marketing mediums such as direct mail and print couldn’t be tracked accurately.”</p>
      <p>One way to increase SEO ranking is to utilize alt text. Alt text is short, descriptive language to describe the products you are selling based on the images posted on your website.</p>
      <p>According to Forbes, the top ten SEO trends that will influence digital marketing (in order) include voice search, video engagement, filtering out non-credible news articles, increased focus on structured snippets, Google’s mobile-first algorithm, social media searches, influencer marketing and link building, awareness campaigns, quality over quantity, and rich media content. SEO will continue to be relevant for a long time, because its success depends on the use of online search engines, which aren’t going away anytime soon.</p>
