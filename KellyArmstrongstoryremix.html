      <h3>Story Ending One</h3>
      <p>I came home from work and found my West Highland White Terrier named Einstein wearing a wonton wrapper. He was panting, running around the house like he was infected
        with rabies. I was so confused. I threw my belongings on the floor and raced to get scissors, but he kept running away. As a crazed dog mom, I was paranoid that he would choke
        and horrified at the thought of my precious puppy suffering. I was even more mortified that this situation could happen again easily, as I thought that the wonton wrapper
        was properly disposed of. I took pictures of him and released him, and he ran around the house elated over nothing. I couldn't help but smile, because he was so cute and excited
        to be alive. I couldn't even be mad at him, because he was so naughty and adorable. Happy Monday.

      <h3>Story Ending Two</h3>
      <p>I came home from work and found my West Highland White Terrier named Einstein in my bathtub eating my bath bomb. I screamed, and grabbed his jaw to try to make him
        spit out whatever he managed to eat so far. I considered calling the poison control center and panicked as he sprinted around the bathroom, wet and wild. He seemed to
        have just injested an energy drink. He leaped over my wiener dog Greta and landed on my design project, crushing forty cumulative hours of blood, sweat, and tears. The
        week was off to an excellent start.
